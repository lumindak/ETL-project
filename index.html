            <h1>Obesity and Percapita Income - ETL</h1>
            <h4>
                The goal of our project was to look at the relationship between a country’s economic 
                conditions and its level of obesity. In order to draw the relationship, GDP as an 
                indication of a country’s economic standing and BMI as an indication of the rate of 
                obesity in said country were used.

              Our dataset from Kaggle examines country’s levels of obesity.
               These values are given as a percentage and show an average across the time period 
               of 1975-2016. Our data set from Wikipedia shows a country’s GDP per capita. 
               These values are listed in dollars. The links to the two data sets are:

              Data was imported to python and cleaned the data. Renamed the headers with more appropriate
              names.  Some of the country names were adjusted so that 
            they were consistent in both data sets. Finally the two data sets were merged inot sinngle Pandas
            dataframe and null values were dropped.

              The final dataset had 165 countries with values for obesity and GDP. It was 
              an acceptable dataset for further analysis. The data was saved in a PostgreSQL Database  
               called Obesity.
